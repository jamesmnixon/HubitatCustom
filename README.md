# Advanced Zwave Plus Dimmer driver - Alpha Release!

The file "Advanced Zwave Plus Dimmer Driver.groovy" is a dimmer driver file that can identify all the parameters for a device and provides input controls allowing the setting of each parameter.

The way this works is that the driver queries the opensmarthouse.com database using the device's manufacturer, device type, and device ID information to retrieve a database record identifying all the parameters for the device. That information is then saved in the device's "state".

#### This is still a work-in-progress. 

Some tips:
* Install the driver on the "Driver Code" page. It will appear with the name "Advanced Zwave Plus Dimmer
* Go to the device that you want to work on and select this driver as the device's driver "Type".
* Click on the "Reset Driver State Data" button to clear the stored "state" inforamtion from the prior driver.
* Click on the "Initialize" control to pull the data from the database and to poll your device for its current parameter settings.
* After this completes, then click on "Save Preferences" and the web page ill now refresh. After it refreshes, the "Preferences" area should now show controls for all of the parameters.  If everything worked right, the controls should show the current settings of your device
* You should now be able to change / udpate the parameters.
